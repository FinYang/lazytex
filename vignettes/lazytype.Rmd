# lazytype


The R package *lazytype* provides addins for inserting code and running code in a different manner, and functions to allow interaction between scripts and between script and rmarkdown file.

## Installation

The **stable** version on R CRAN is coming soon.

You can install the **development** version from [Github](https://github.com/FinYang/lazytype) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FinYang/lazytype")
```


## Keep the PC awake

`dont_sign_me_out(hours = 3.5)` moves mouse every 5 minutes for a certain time (default 3.5 hours) and print the time elapsed in the console. It is mainly used on public PC where it signs you out for a certain period of inactivity.

## LazyScript

`LazyScript` operations helps with interacting with scripts and rmarkdown files, saves time to copy and paste and provides means to arrange code in a different way.

Assume in the current working directory there is a script file named `test.R` with the following contents.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## ---- library ----
library(tidyverse)
## ---- hello ----
print("Hello World")

```

`read_script("test.R", library = TRUE)` reads in the code in the `test.R` file and executes the chunk labelled _library_ if argument has been set to `library = TRUE`. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(lazytype)
script_test <- read_script("test.R", library = TRUE)


```


`%run%` can be used to run a chunk from `test.R` file with a specified label.

```{r eval = FALSE}
script_test %run% "hello"
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
print("Hello World")
```

In other words, `read_script` provides a `knitr::read_chunk` equivalent in script files.

`copy_script_to_rmd` copies code in the script to the rmd file in the form of chunks based on the section header. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
copy_script_to_rmd("test.R", "test.Rmd", match_chunk = FALSE)
```

In the `test.Rmd` file, after the existing text, the code in `test.R` will be appended to the end in the following form.


```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("test.png")
```



## Addins

The package provides various addins, aiming to decrease keystrokes and clicks. 
<!-- A complete usage of addins please consult `vignette-addins` (coming soon). -->

#### Run All up to Cursor

`run_all_to_cursor` by its name, run the code in the current script above the cursor. I suggest binding this addin with shortcut `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`R`.

#### Run Selected Arguments

`run_selected_arguments` runs selected code, ignoring the comma. It normally is used to set the default arguments of a function where the arguments are separated by comma. Useful for testing function with different arguments. I suggest binding this addin with shortcut `Alt`+`R`.

#### Insert Purl Section
`insert_purl_section` insert `## ----  ----` at an empty line in the script, or turns a non-empty line to a comment with purl section header `## ----` (or turns it back). The header is recognised by `knitr::read_chunk` to read code for each chunk in the rmarkdown file from R script. See `?knitr::read_chunk` for more details. I suggest binding this addin with shortcut `Shift`+`Ctrl`+`Q`.



#### Insert Rmarkdown Chunk (Edit Label)
`insert_rmarkdown_chunk_editlabel` insert Rmarkdown Chunk with cursor placed at the label. Just a shortcut to insert chunk without any code in it to use with `knitr::read_chunk`. I suggest binding this addin with shortcut `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`O`.

#### Insert Scoping Assignment Operator

`insert_scoping_assignment` insert ` <<- ` at cursor. Binding to `Alt`+`=` is suggested.
